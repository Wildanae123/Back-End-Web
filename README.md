---

## üöÄ Deployment: Docker

- Containers package the app and dependencies for consistent environments.
- Works across local, staging, and production platforms.
- Eases scaling, updates, and rollbacks.
- Isolates from system-level dependencies.

---

## üîî Webhooks: Event-Driven Updates

- Push real-time updates for book additions and user activity.
- Improves responsiveness and reduces client-side polling.
- Keeps the user interface in sync with backend changes.

---

## üìã Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed:

- üê≥ **Docker & Docker Compose** ‚Äì Ensure you have both installed on your system. Docker Desktop usually includes Docker Compose.
- üü© **Node.js & npm/yarn** ‚Äì Required for sequelize-cli and potentially running the app locally if you choose, though we'll focus on Docker.
- üîÅ **Postman** ‚Äì For API testing.
- üìÅ **Project Files** ‚Äì Ensure your Express.js project is ready.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 1: Project Configuration (`.env` file)

1. In the root of your **`ghibli-food-receipt-api`** project, create a `.env` file (if it doesn‚Äôt already exist
2. Copy the contents from your existing `.env.example` file into the newly created `.env` file.
3. Update the database-related variables inside `.env` specifically for **Docker Compose** usage.

> üìù **Note**: Docker Compose allows services to refer to each other by their **service names**. We'll name our PostgreSQL database service `db`.

#### üìÅ Example `.env` Configuration:

```ini
# .env

PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development

# Database (PostgreSQL with Sequelize)
DB_HOST=db              # <-- IMPORTANT: Use the Docker service name, not 'localhost'
DB_PORT=5432            # Standard PostgreSQL port (internal to Docker network)
DB_USER=ghibli_api_user # You'll define this in docker-compose.yml for Postgres
DB_PASSWORD=your_strong_password_for_api_user # (e.g MySecureAppPass123!)
DB_NAME=ghibli_food_db  # You'll define this in docker-compose.yml

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_RaNDOM_jwt_secret # (command to create node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))")
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1d

# Auth0 (Fill these if directly integrating Auth0 for token validation)
# AUTH0_DOMAIN=your-auth0-domain.auth0.com
# AUTH0_AUDIENCE=your-api-identifier
```

### üöÄ Step 2: Run the Application with Docker Compose

1. Open your terminal in the root of your `ghibli-food-receipt-api` project (where your `docker-compose.yml` file lives), then run:

2. Build and start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

3. Check container status:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

4. View logs (especially if something goes wrong):

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs db
   docker-compose logs api
   ```

### üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Run Database Migrations

Once the db container is up and running, and PostgreSQL has initialized your database and user, you need to run your Sequelize migrations to create the tables (Users, Books, UserBooks).

Execute the migration command inside the running api container:

```bash
docker-compose exec api npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
```

### üå± Step 4: Seed Initial Data (e.g., Admin User)

If you need an admin user to start testing admin-protected routes, you'll need to create one.

1. Follow the manual method (hashing script + `docker-compose exec db psql -U ${DB_USER} -d ${DB_NAME}` to run SQL INSERT) as described in previous answers.

   - Connect to psql in your DB container:

     ```bash
     docker-compose exec db psql -U ghibli_api_user -d ghibli_food_db
     ```

   - Then run the INSERT statement with the hashed password.

   OR

2. Create and run a Sequelize Seeder (more advanced, but good for repeatable setups):

   - `npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name initial-admin-user`
   - Edit the seeder file to hash a password and create the admin user.
   - Run the seeder: `docker-compose exec api npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`

> üìù **Note**: List PostgreSQL useful command `\dt`, `SELECT * FROM "Users";`, `DELETE FROM "Users";` or `TRUNCATE TABLE "Users", "Books" RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE;`

### üß™ Step 5: Testing with Postman

1. Import Collection: Ensure your `ghibli-api-postman.json` is imported into Postman.
2. Base URL: Your API should be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. The requests in the collection use `{{baseUrl}}` which is set to `/api/v1` path relative to the server URL `http://localhost:5000`. So, requests will go to `http://localhost:5000/api/v1/...`.
3. Authentication Flow:
   All endpoints are grouped by category and summarized in a structured table format.

> üìù **Note**: All authentication is handled via **HttpOnly cookies**. Make sure your API clients (like Postman) support cookie management.

4. Check Responses: Verify that the API responds as expected based on your controller logic.
5. Check Database (Optional): You can use a tool like DBeaver or pgAdmin to connect to your PostgreSQL database (Host: `localhost`, Port: `5432`, User: `ghibli_api_user`, Password: `from your .env`, Database: `ghibli_food_db`) to see the data being created/updated/deleted.

### ‚èπÔ∏è Step 6: Stopping the Application

When you're done:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To remove the persisted database volume as well (and lose all DB data):

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
